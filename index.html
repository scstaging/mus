                        <h2 class="inner-text fade-left">Jung Station is a musical project created by award-winning Songwriter/ Composer / Producer Anthony Vanderburgh.<br><br>“Jung Station is a vehicle to get a backlog of my unreleased songs out there,” Vanderburgh says. “I discovered a dusty old cassette of The Night That Time Stood Still— a heart wrenching piece I always loved. I suddenly realized it needed a third section and added the extended guitar solo. This new version was recorded over a few days, and with Zlatko Cetinic directing, we froze our butts off shooting the video at Toronto’s Kew Beach in February 2023.”<br><br>Jung Station is working up new songs. <br>Thanks for visiting and stay tuned for more! </h2>
